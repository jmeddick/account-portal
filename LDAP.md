Terminology:

- **UID**:
  - in Unix, this would be "username", but we use LDAP terminology
  - by default our UIDs are based on [the EPPN attribute](https://spaces.at.internet2.edu/spaces/federation/pages/181634464/user-attr-eppn)
- **GID**:
  - in Unix, this would be "group name", but we use LDAP terminology
  - every user gets their own group with a group name equal to their username
    - see [User Private Groups](https://wiki.debian.org/UserPrivateGroups)
- **UID number**:
  - in Unix, this would be "UID", but we use LDAP terminology
  - all users created by the account portal have equal UID numbers and GID numbers
  - see `custom_user_mappings`
- **GID number**:
  - in Unix, this would be "GID", but we use LDAP terminology
  - all users created by the account portal have equal UID numbers and GID numbers
  - see `custom_user_mappings`
- **qualified user**:
  - a user who is currently a PI or a member of at least one PI group
  - your other services should require this group for authorization
- **unqualified user**:
  - inverse of qualified
- **native user**:
  - a user whose entries exist in the OUs given in `config.ini`
- **non-native user**:
  - inverse of native
  - users created for administrative purposes should not be mixed with native users in the LDAP OUs given in `config.ini` or else this account portal may get confused
- **locked user**:
  - a user who has been manually denied access to your services by an admin
  - this account portal gives HTTP 403 permission denied for these users on any page where httpd has authentication
  - your other services should block this group for authorization
- **idlelocked user**:
  - a user who has been inactive for so long that they lose access to your services
  - as soon as they log in to this account portal, this flag is removed
  - your other services should block this group for authorization
- **immortal user**:
  - a user who is not automatically idlelocked or disabled
- **disabled user**:
  - a user that we pretend does not exist
  - TODO user can disable their account in the GUI
  - TODO if a user is inactive for too long, they expire and become disabled
  - `sshpublickey` attribute should be empty
  - your other services should block this group for authorization
  - if you have any integrations (ex: creating home directories), they should take care to ignore these users
- **disabled group**:
  - a PI group that we pretend does not exist
  - owner can disable their group in the GUI, admin can disable any group in the GUI
  - if the owner is disabled, their group is also disabled
  - `memberuid` attribute should be empty
  - if you have any integrations (ex: updating slurm account DB), they should take care to ignore these PI groups
- **association**:
  - a user is _associated_ with a PI group (and vice versa) if they are the owner, a member, or a manager
- **manager**:
  - a user who has been granted authority over a PI group
  - a manager must also be a member
  - TODO there is no GUI for a PI to promote a user to manager, only an admin can do it
