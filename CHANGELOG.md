### 1.4 -> 1.5

### 1.3 -> 1.4

- the `user_created ` mail template has been renamed to `user_qualified`
- the `user_dequalified` mail template has been added

In v1.2.1, we extended PI group requests and PI group join requests to store user info like name and email.
This was necessary because LDAP entries were not created for users until they became "qualified" (become a PI or joined a PI group).
While a user was unqualified, if the Redis cache was cleared, the user info would be lost.
Now, LDAP entries are created immediately for every user, so this is no longer necessary.

- Shut down the web portal
  ```shell
  systemctl stop apache2
  ```
- Create LDAP entries for all existing requests
  ```php
  use UnityWebPortal\lib\UnityUser;
  $_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"] = "worker"; // see deployment/overrides/worker/
  $_SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"] = "127.0.0.1";
  require_once __DIR__ . "/../resources/autoload.php";
  foreach ($SQL->getAllRequests() as $request) {
    $user = new UnityUser($request["uid"], $LDAP, $SQL, $MAILER, $WEBHOOK);
    if (!$user->exists()) {
      echo "creating user: " . jsonEncode($request) . "\n";
      $user->init(
        $request["firstname"],
        $request["lastname"],
        $request["email"],
        $request["org"],
      );
    }
  }
  ```
- Remove columns from the `requests` table:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE `requests`
  DROP COLUMN `firstname`,
  DROP COLUMN `lastname`,
  DROP COLUMN `email`,
  DROP COLUMN `org`;
  ```
- Update the portal PHP code following the normal procedure
- Start the portal again
  ```shell
  systemctl start apache2
  ```

### 1.2 -> 1.3

- SQL:
  - remove the `sitevars` table
- `defaults/config.ini.default` has some new fields that need to be overriden:
  - `offset_UIDGID`
  - `offset_PIGID`
  - `offset_ORGGID`
- `custom_user_mappings` can no longer match with just the 1st segment of the logged in user's UID, an exact match is required
- LDAP:
  - create the `gecos` attribute for all users by concatenating `givenName` and `sn`

### 1.2.0 -> 1.2.1

- SQL:
  - Add new columns to the `requests` table:
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE `requests`
    ADD `firstname` VARCHAR(768) NOT NULL AFTER `timestamp`,
    ADD `lastname` VARCHAR(768) NOT NULL AFTER `firstname`,
    ADD `email` VARCHAR(768) NOT NULL AFTER `lastname`,
    ADD `org` VARCHAR(768) NOT NULL AFTER `email`;
    ```

- `defaults/config.ini.default` has some new fields that may need to be overriden:
  - `ldap.user_group`
  - `site.terms_of_service_url`
    - example, created account policy page: `https://unity.rc.umass.edu/panel/account_policy.php`
